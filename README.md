# LazyScripts
In this repository, I've gathered a collection of scripts and mini-automations that I've developed and found invaluable in my day-to-day activities, helping me boost productivity and streamline tasks. As I journey through the maze of digital demands, I've realized the importance of documenting these tools not only for present efficiency but also as a safeguard against the inevitable RAM overload that comes with aging. Consider this Read-me a treasure trove of shortcuts, a digital memory bank to aid you in your quest for productivity mastery. Dive in, explore, and may these scripts serve you well on your own productivity odyssey.
